# What is it?  
VEXS is a variant of the XSBench mini-app (https://github.com/ANL-CESAR/XSBench) that specifically tries to capture finer details of the memory and compute model that XSBench, by necessity, approximates. It is targeted specifically at performance analysis and prediction on platforms where more limited memory and compute resources might make the hardware more sensitive to approximations and assumptions that CPU-based platforms may not be sensitive to.
